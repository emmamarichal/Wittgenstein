### Precision and Modernity in Every Stroke

Introducing Wittgenstein, a typeface that redefines serif typography with clarity and sophistication. Inspired by the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein, who recognized that what can be said can be said clearly, this font embodies his ethos with its sharp, well-defined form.

### Why Wittgenstein Stands Out

- Clarity in Design: Each letter is meticulously crafted with clear, sharp serifs that are more than just decorative—they command attention.

- Versatile Styles: Available in five weights, from Regular to Black, and in italics, Wittgenstein adapts to any project. Its variable fonts with weight axis provide flexibility for diverse design needs.

- Historical Elegance: This modern interpretation of Georg Trump's Mediaeval Old Style font and Walter Diethelm's Antiqua from the 1950s offers a broad-nib touch with contemporary flair.

## Designer

### Jörg Drees: A Journey from Letterpress to AI

Growing up in northern Germany, Jörg was surrounded by the art of letterpress typesetting, thanks to his parents' printing shop. He picked up the craft early on, and after training as a typographer, he honed his skills under Hans Rudolf Bosshard in Zurich, where he also designed his first typefaces.

Nowadays, he works with news publishers and explores the cutting edge of AI in layout design. Next to his professional endeavors, font design has always been a personal passion. It’s his go-to for inspiration and relaxation, and Jörg continues to create beautiful typefaces in his own time.
